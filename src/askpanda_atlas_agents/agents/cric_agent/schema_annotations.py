"""Human-readable annotations for all fields in the ingestion-agent DuckDB schema.

This module provides plain-English descriptions of every column in the
``jobs``, ``selectionsummary``, and ``errors_by_count`` tables.  The
annotations are intended to be injected into LLM prompts so the model
understands what each field means when a user asks a question that requires
a database lookup.

The descriptions are intentionally written from the perspective of someone
unfamiliar with PanDA internals — they explain *what the field represents*
rather than how it is stored.

Usage example::

    from askpanda_atlas_agents.common.storage.schema_annotations import (
        JOBS_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS,
        ALL_FIELD_DESCRIPTIONS,
        get_schema_context,
    )

    # Inject a compact schema summary into an LLM system prompt:
    system_prompt = f"You have access to a jobs database.\\n{get_schema_context()}"
